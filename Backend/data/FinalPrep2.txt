Geocoding,"Data.com geocoding works only for Acct, Contact and Leads standard address fields.
It does not work on Person acct.Use Google geocoding for custom objects"

custom sharing reason to prevent this. However 'custom sharing reason' works only
for custom objects"
Email,"No limits sent via UI/APEX to individual Contact, Lead, Account and User. 5000 email limit for ext addresses"
Flows,"Recommend Flow based schedule path over TBW as it goves more precise control : in mins, more 
integrated with overall flow, advanced capabilities like send email every day"
Multi-orgs,"Multi -org (additional justification) - Markets growing differently, AUS goes first"
Security,Records created by Cust commie user cannot be shared internally with sharing - only option is Share group
Oppty,"Chk discount and other fields on Order 
- Custom discount field needs to be created on OrderLI, WF to update the Sales price amt which would get reflected on the total Order amt automatically.
- Oppty LI has a std discount field which updates the Sales price of OLI automatically
-Oppty does not have a discount field. Hence, we cannot give blanket discount unless done via customization
quote and Quote Line items have discount fields"
SSO/OAUTH,ADFS cannot do de-provisioning and cannot connect to multiple ADs

Email to lead,"NA OOTB, app x apps, email service with InboundEmailHandler apex to create the Leads"
Security,"When should the owner be changed versus providing access via APEX? - Change owner if we want to give TRANSFER perm, queue is involved, makes logical sense for that
 user to own the record, that user would be the main person to work on the record going forward, DO NOT change owner if limited access is needed and it is temporary"

Risks slide,"If there is a mobile publisher , then express the delivery risk , playstore can take days and weeks and this can be mitigated by submitting the app early on the schedule.
If there is canvas integration, then express dependency risk with other system, This can be mitigated by milestones and contract first development
If there Buy decision , then procurement is a risk If the project deadline is fixed , express the risk for scope of project , handle in governance - Mitigation would be to create MVP , MVP scope is also a risk as it need buyin from all stakeholders.
If multiple teams are involved in the implementation, express the risk that building the common understanding may be challenging , mitigation steps would be - Schedule common meetings , Organise a clear way of communication and collaboration
Any explicit risk mentioned in the scenario ---
Since the XXX would be using the mobile publisher app, there is a delivery risk , the play store and apple store can take days and weeks to get the app live and this can be mitigated by submitting the app early on the schedule.
Since there is a canvas/or integration between SF and XXX, then there is dependency risk with other system, This can be mitigated by milestones and contract first development
For the App exchange apps, the procurement of the app licences might take time. This is a delivery risk. This can be mitigated by involvement of sponsors and purchasing the app early on the schedule. Since the project deadline is fixed , there is the risk of missing the deadline due to scope of the project . Mitigation steps would be to create MVP and get buy-in from all the concerned stakeholders for the MVP scope.
Since multiple teams are involved in the implementation, building the common understanding may be challenging , mitigation steps would be to Schedule common meetings , and Organise a clear way of communication and collaboration
Since the XXX solution is complex, I propose to do a proof of concept to check feasibility of the solution.

SAML - Authentication , XML based, 1 and 2 version
OAUTH - Authorization, secure access to resources OpenID connect - Federated authentication on top of OAUTh2 , uses JSON ID Token with scopes and endpoint discovery"

SSO/OAUTH,Login discovery - default behavior . Prompt user for email or phone . Send SMS/EMAIL based on which identifier (ph/email) was supplied with verification code. If correct allow login. Handler generated automatically which could be overridden
SSO/OAUTH,"JIT is done via SAML or OpenID connect through SAML assertion and JWT token respectively. Params are sent via Map<String, String> and Auth.Data object
For SAML JIT in SF, set the 'user prov flag' on SSO settings . Default SAMLJITHandler or a custom handler can be used for this.
FOR openID JIT in SF, use the Auth.RegistrationHandler class default or custom for creating users"
SSO/OAUTH,Custom claims can be used to inckude additional attribs from the User object then those included via STD claims. These are used in openID connect flow
